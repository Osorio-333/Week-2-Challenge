            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Oscar Osorio and I am 20 years old. I've lived in Riverbank, CA my entire life. I am currently a student at UC Davis Coding Bootcamp, which has taught me how to code this website. I'm looking to begin a career in web development or software engineering. 
                I have two dogs. A bulldog named Stormi who just turned 3 years old and a shi tzu named Piggy who is 5 years old. I also have an African Grey Parrot named Ally which I've had the longest for about 9-10 years. Some fun facts about these animals is that Stormi really enjoys her sleep, Piggy makes noises that makes her actually sound like a pig and Ally like whistling a whole lot.
                A fun fact about myself is that I enjoy collecting records. I currently have about 60+ records and collection is still growing. A few of my favorites consist of Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) by the Wu-Tang Clan, The Elephant Man's Bones by Roc Marciano and Super Tecmo Bo by Boldy James.
